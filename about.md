Hello! I'm Ralph.

I currently work on software that helps people ship their parcels all over the world. My day to day includes creating new REST services, updating an angular component or helping refine various requirements. Currently, I use Angular 8 and Typescript for the front end web application and Java and Spring for the back end services.
