I am a full stack developer based in Ottawa, Canada. I love working on different areas of software development, from gathering requirements with clients to designing front-end user interfaces to implementing back-end systems. I’m passionate about what I do and always looking to learn something new.

I have worked with all sorts of technologies but I am most familiar with the following stack: Java, Spring, Javascript, JQuery, Oracle DB.

Other technologies that I have used throughout my career includes:
*Back-end: Struts, C#, .NET, Ruby, Ruby on Rails
*Front-end: React, Redux, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS
*Database: PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server

If you’re interested in having me on your team or work on a project, I would love to hear about it. Feel free to email me ralph.bolo(at)gmail.com .
